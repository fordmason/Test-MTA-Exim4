NAME
    Test::MTA::Exim4 - Test Anything interface for testing Exim4
    configurations

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    Test::MTA::Exim4 allows the testing of an "exim" installation and
    configuration using the perl TAP (Test Anything Protocol) methodology.

    This allows the writing of some simple test scripts which can check for
    features of "exim" and check that this configuration routes, accepts or
    rejects mail as you would expect. As such it is an ideal system for
    creating a test suite for your mail configuration allowing you to check
    that there are no unexpected regressions when you make a change.

METHODS
  new
        my $exim = Test::MTA::Exim4->new( \%fields );

    Create a new exim configuration testing object. You may pass
    configuration information in as a hash reference - this is the only
    point at which the locations of the exim binary and configuration file
    may be set.

  reset
    Resets the internal state. Not sure when this might be useful!

  config_ok
    Checks that "exim" considers the configuration file as syntactically
    valid. The config file must be specified when "new" is called, otherwise
    the default is used.

  exim_version
    Returns the version of "exim" seen when the configuration was checked.
    This is intended for use within your own tests for appropriate versions,
    for example:-

        # ensure we are running exim 4.69 or later
        ok(($exim->exim_version gt '4.69'), 'Exim version check');

  exim_build
    Returns the build number of "exim" seen when the configuration was
    checked. This is intended for use within your own tests for appropriate
    versions/builds.

        # ensure we are running exim 4.69 or later
        ok(($exim->exim_version gt '4.69'), 'Exim version check');

  has_capability
        $exim->has_capability($type, $what, $optional_msg)
        $exim->has_capability('lookup', 'lsearch', 'Has lsearch capability')

    Checks that "exim" has the appropriate capability. This is taken from
    the lists of capabilities listed by "exim -bV"

    The types of capability are:-

    *   support_for

    *   lookup

    *   authenticator

    *   router

    *   transport

    The items within a capability are processed to be lowercase alphanumeric
    only - so "iconv" rather than "iconv()" as output by exim. The subitems
    (for example "maildir" is a subitem of "appendfile") are treated as
    separately checkable items.

  has_not_capability
    Precisely the opposite of has_capability with an opposite test - so
    fails if this does exist.

INTERNAL METHODS
    These methods are not intended to be run by end users, but are exposed.

  _run_exim_command
    Runs an exim instance with the appropriate config file and

  _run_exim_bv
    Runs "exim -bV" with the appropriate configuration file, to check that
    the configuration file is valid. The output of the command is parsed and
    stashed and used to provide the functions to check versions numbers and
    capabilities.

  _diag
    Spits out some Test::Builder diagnostics for the last run command. Used
    internally by some tests on failure. The output data is the last error
    seen by IPC::Cmd and the complete output of the command.

SUPPORT
    You can find documentation for this module with the perldoc command.

  Warning
        At this point the module is *not* released to CPAN - still in early
        development and subject to change in a big way (including renaming,
        or even just dropping it). However when/if it is released, further
        information will be found at these locations

    You can also look for information at:

        always be here)

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    The module draws very strongly on the Test::Exim4::Routing module by Max
    Maischein. It is structured differently, and is currently very
    experimental (meaning the API may change in a big way), so these changes
    were made as a new module in a name space that is intended for use by
    similar modules for other MTAs.
